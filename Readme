Spam/Ham Classification - Made By Jeet S. Chauhan
This is a Spam/Ham Classification model made using Python with the help of many ML Liabraries like : SKlearn, Numpy, Pandas and NLTK. We have plotted the body length distribution at the end with the help of MatPlotLib Liabrary.

This Project encompasses many topics in NLP. Topics such as Tokenization, Removing Stopwords, Stemming, Lemmenting, Vectorization, use of Sparse Matrix which ultimately help creating this project.

This project works basically by reducing the contents of message into keywords with no punctuations and using that to train a model which can then classify new unseen messages into Spam or Ham.

NLTK- Natural Language Toolkit- The NLTK is the most utilised package for handling natural language processing tasks. It is an open source library.
